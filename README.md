# xgbrank
Ranking using XGBoost

Originally by: https://github.com/bigdong89/xgboostExtension/blob/master/xgboostextension/xgbranker.py

However, this implementation expects a group id for every example instead of forcing the data to be ordered by group.
Works with xgboost version 0.82

Python 2.7 or Python 3 (once you get rid of the silly prints)
